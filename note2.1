=======================================
Interactive Website: 

1. <foot> tag in HTML5
    $copy;   copy right symbol
2. <nav> tag
   Semantic tag - Semantic tags don't include any extra styling—they’re block elements, 
   like divs—but they do help you create meaningful markup for other humans, screen readers, and browsers.

   Other HTML5 tags include <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <aside> are non-semantic- they tell notthing about the content they contain.
   Semantic elements : <form>, <table>, and <img>. They clearly define their content.

   3. customise the footer with pseudo-classes.
   
     :active : change text color/style of a link when it clicked. 
     :visited: change the text color/style of a link once it has been clicked (the link has been visited)
     
     Pseudo-class syntax :  
     selector:pseudo-class {
         property: value;
     }
